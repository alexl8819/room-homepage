## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Room Homepage](https://alexl8819.github.io/room-homepage/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - JS Bundler
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This was my first actual attempt of writing my own mobile nav without the use of a third party library. I am ok with it overall however I definitely think there could be improvements such as the translucent mask
that does not fully cover the viewport (admittedly a bug). I also decided to use no JS framework for this one as I wanted to go as bare-bones as possible and rely mainly on CSS.

### Continued development

As always the goal is to write a readable (easy to understand), clean (linted) and tested codebase. I will be focusing on performance metrics again soon and begin to implement SEO into future projects.

### TODO
- Working tests
